    <h1>🌸Hello! I’m Jenny🌸</h1>
    <p>I find joy in life’s simple pleasures: baking, spending time with animals, and gardening. 🎂Baking, in particular, is very close to my heart. There’s something truly comforting about measuring, mixing, and watching a recipe come to life. Sharing sweet treats with others brings me immense happiness; it’s my way of showing I care.</p>
    <p>🐶I am also an animal lover. Pets bring so much warmth and unconditional love into my life. Whether I’m feeding them, playing with them, or simply sitting beside them, animals have a wonderful way of brightening my day.</p>
    <p>🪴Gardening is another peaceful passion of mine. Watching something grow from a tiny seed to a blooming plant is incredibly rewarding. Whether it’s flowers, herbs, or a few pots on a windowsill, nurturing nature helps me feel grounded and connected.</p>
    <p>I enjoy keeping things organized and finding little ways to make everyday life more enjoyable. For me, life is about growing, learning, and appreciating the small things that bring happiness.</p>
